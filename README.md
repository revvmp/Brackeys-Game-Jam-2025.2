# Game Idea
Gambling Based Variety Game Similar to Wario Ware, where each user starts with a certain amount of money.
They play a variety of gambling games to try to make as much money as possible. 
If they hit $0, then their entire account gets deleted (permadeath).
The ultimate prize being a physical biscuit users can buy for $1,000,000 in the achievement shop.
